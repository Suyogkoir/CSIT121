            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm an international student who first arrived in Missouri in August 2022 before transferring to CCBC Essex in Fall 2023.
                Adjusting to new places has been a journey, full of challenges and adventures. Fun fact or it may not sound funny, I once almost 
                drowned and died, definitely an experience I won't forget anytime soon!
